# CHANGELOG

We absolutely welcome any code contributions and we hope that this
guide will facilitate an understanding of the ansys-tools-path code
repository. It is important to note that while the ansys-tools-path software
package is maintained by ANSYS and any submissions will be reviewed
thoroughly before merging, we still seek to foster a community that can
support user questions and develop new features to make this software
a useful tool for all users.  As such, we welcome and encourage any
questions or submissions to this repository.
